ionic-todo2
==========
second pass at experimental code learning ionic framework for mobile hibrid todo applications

this is additional work to [previous code](https://github.com/edlovesjava/ionic-todo) but adding the following stories:

 * as a user I wish to rename a project
 * as a user I wish to remove a project and its tasks
 * as a user I wish to see tasks in order of most recently added
 * as a user I wish to hide the tasks that are done
